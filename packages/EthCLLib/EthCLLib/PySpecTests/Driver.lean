# `EthCLLib.PySpecTests.Driver`: the generic, fork-agnostic driver

The single-step / fold-compare-root half of `PySpecTests`
(`FRAMEWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md` §13.2). Written against `ForkInterface`, so it names
no concrete fork and lives in `EthCLLib`. A `CaseRequest` (decoded from the wire
by the runner) is dispatched by `(runner, handler)` to the right interface
method; the resulting post root is compared against the vector's expected root,
and the outcome is classified into one of the error model's buckets.

The reject-faithfulness audit (`SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §10.2) is encoded in
`classify`:

| Vector | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| valid (`post` present) | root matches | pass |
| valid | any error, or wrong root | fail |
| invalid (`post` absent) | `assert` reject | pass |
| invalid | `outOfBounds` / `missingKey` reject | pass, **flagged** (bug-smell) |
| invalid | `todo` reject | fail (an unimplemented path is not a validation) |
| invalid | ran clean | fail (should have rejected) |

The step/check interpreter (`fork_choice`) and the delta-comparison (`rewards`)
have different shapes and join in Phase 2.3 / 2.5; this driver reports them as
out-of-scope `todo` until then.
