-- LeanHazmatKzg subpackage: Lake configuration.
--
-- Procedural `lakefile.lean` (not TOML) because it compiles vendored C
-- into an `extern_lib`. c-kzg-4844 is vendored, `just hazmat-kzg-vendor`
-- shallow-clones the pinned tag (v2.1.7) into `vendor/c-kzg-4844/` (NOT
-- its `--recursive` blst), and copies the trusted setup into `data/`.
--
-- This is the one LeanHazmat family that `require`s another: it shares
-- LeanHazmatBls's single compiled **blst** archive rather than vendoring
-- a second copy (hazmat-docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4). c-kzg v2.1.7 pins blst
-- exactly at v0.3.16, the LeanHazmatBls pin, so the headers and ABI
-- match. At compile time c-kzg needs blst's `bindings/` on the include
-- path; the `blst_*` symbols come from LeanHazmatBls's archive.
--
-- Build shape (verified): compile c-kzg's own single-TU amalgamation
-- `src/ckzg.c` (it `#include`s every other `.c`) plus the Lean shim, and
-- embed the trusted setup via `.incbin`. No `-D` flags for c-kzg itself.
