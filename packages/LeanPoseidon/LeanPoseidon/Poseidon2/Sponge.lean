# `LeanPoseidon.Sponge` — a sponge over arbitrary-length input

`hash` absorbs an arbitrary-length sequence of field elements into the
width-3 state and squeezes one element out.

## Sponge vocabulary (for the Lean-fluent reader)

A *sponge* absorbs input `rate` elements at a time into the state, running
the permutation between absorptions, then *squeezes* output elements out.
*Rate* is how many state slots take input per permutation (here
`t − 1 = 2`); *capacity* (here the 1 remaining slot) is held back and
never directly touched by input — that reserved slot is what gives the
construction its security margin.

## ⚠ Conformance status — convention documented, external KAT pending

Unlike `compress` (whose definition is pinned by `zkhash`'s
`MerkleTreeHash` and KAT-validated), **the sponge construction over
arbitrary input is not pinned by an upstream reference we can test
against**: `zkhash` ships only the permutation and the 2-to-1 `compress`,
and EIP-7864's `bytes → field` / domain-separation encoding is explicitly
undetermined (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §"Relationship to the rest of the
monorepo"). So this file fixes *a* concrete, documented convention and
checks it for internal consistency against `permute`; a
cross-implementation KAT is deferred until an upstream Poseidon2 sponge
(or EIP-7864) settles the convention. Per the project's
"don't invent ahead of the spec" stance, depend on `compress` for
consensus-relevant work; treat `hash` as a documented reference sponge.

## The convention fixed here

* state width `t = 3`, `rate = 2`, capacity `1`; initial state `[0,0,0]`;
* **padding**: append a single `1`, then `0`s, until the length is a
  multiple of `rate` (a field analogue of `10*` multi-rate padding — it
  keeps inputs differing only by trailing structure distinct);
* **absorb**: for each `rate`-element chunk, *add* the chunk into the
  first `rate` state slots and permute;
* **squeeze**: output the single element at position 0.

/-! ## Internal-consistency gates

These check the sponge *plumbing* against `permute` under the convention
above — not against an external reference (none is pinned; see the module
docstring). The empty input pads to one chunk `[1, 0]`, so its hash must be
`permute([1,0,0])[0]`. -/

#guard hash #[] = #[(permute bn254Params (#v[Bn254Fr.ofNat 1, Bn254Fr.ofNat 0, Bn254Fr.ofNat 0]))[0]]
