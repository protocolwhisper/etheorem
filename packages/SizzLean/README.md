# SizzLean - serialization, part of a well verified breakfast.

A Lean 4 implementation of Ethereum's
[SSZ](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/ssz/simple-serialize.md)
(Simple Serialize): serialization, deserialization, Merkleization,
cached-tree machinery, and the `sszUpdate` macro surface — all of
it sharing one library between production code and machine-checked
theorems.

## Why SizzLean

- **Write once, pick your backend.** Code written against this
  library runs on either of two implementations under the hood — a
  heavily optimised cached Merkle tree for production speed, or a
  simple uncached version that's friendly to Lean proofs. You
  choose at the call site; the spec or state-transition function
  you wrote doesn't change. No duplicated source between the
  runtime path and the verification path.

- **Validated against Ethereum's test corpus.** Passes both
  upstream SSZ suites from `ethereum/consensus-spec-tests` (release
  `v1.6.0-beta.0`) end-to-end on the mainnet preset:
  `ssz_generic` (2188 / 2188 in-scope cases — the wire-format
  tests; 292 progressive-container cases are deliberately out of
  scope, see the "deliberately not implemented" table below) and
  `ssz_static` (1585 / 1585 cases on mainnet preset, every fork
  from Phase 0 through Fulu — the per-fork consensus-container
  tests). SHA-256 passes the NIST CAVP vectors on every hasher
  the library ships.

- **Literate by default.** SizzLean sits at the intersection of
  two specialist worlds — SSZ and Lean 4 — and most readers only
  know one. The library is written with comments that teach the
  reader what the code does *and* the Lean idioms it uses, so a
  Lean-fluent reader can pick up the SSZ semantics and an
  SSZ-fluent reader can pick up the Lean. The cost is paid once
  when the code is written; the dividend compounds with every new
  contributor.

- **Fast hash-tree-root.** Updates are incremental: only the
  path from a changed field to the root rehashes. Multi-field
  updates batch the work across overlapping paths.

- **Zero boilerplate per type.** Add `deriving SSZRepr` to your
  Lean structure and you get serialization, deserialization,
  hash-tree-root, and the central correctness theorems — for
  free, per type, with no hand-written proofs.

- **Trust assumptions you can grep for.** Every reliance on the
  C SHA-256 implementation is named and audit-listed — it shows
  up in any proof's trust footprint, and is replaceable later
  by a proof without touching a single theorem statement.

- **Pluggable hash function.** Today it's SHA-256. Tomorrow it
  can be Poseidon2 — or whatever the Beam Chain redesign settles
  on — without rewriting your containers, your proofs, or your
  cache logic.

- **Every Ethereum consensus fork covered.** Phase 0 through
  Gloas, including the new ePBS containers.

## Scope

Provides the SSZ *library* — types and primitives. Consensus-spec
container definitions (Phase0 → Gloas) live in the sibling
`LeanEthCS` package.

## Status

**Experimental, conformance-validated.** Every SSZ type used by
the Ethereum consensus spec from Phase 0 through Gloas is
implemented. Upstream test suites (`ethereum/consensus-spec-tests
v1.6.0-beta.0`) pass clean on mainnet preset:

* `ssz_generic --all` — **2188 / 2188** in-scope cases passed,
  0 failed. Plus **292** deliberately skipped progressive-container
  cases (see the "deliberately not implemented" table); the
  conformance harness classifies them as `out of library scope`,
  not failures.
* `ssz_static --config mainnet --all` — **1585 / 1585** cases
  passed across every fork Phase 0 → Fulu. Per-PR CI runs the
  `--limit 1` smoke (634 / 634); the full sweep is the
  `workflow_dispatch` button.

The minimal-preset `ssz_static` sweep currently exposes a known
LeanEthCS-side gap (sibling package, not SizzLean): the
consensus-container schemas pin preset constants to mainnet, so
types whose layout differs between presets (e.g.
`KZG_COMMITMENT_INCLUSION_PROOF_DEPTH = 10` minimal vs `17`
mainnet ⇒ a 224-byte schema mismatch on `BlobSidecar` /
`BeaconBlockBody` and post-Deneb derivatives) re-serialise to the
wrong width. Tracked in LeanEthCS; the SizzLean library itself
is preset-agnostic and the failure is in the user-side schema
declarations, not in `SSZType` / `serialize` / `deserialize` /
`hashTreeRoot`.

### SSZ types implemented

| Type | Notes |
|---|---|
| `uintN` for `N ∈ {8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}` | Per spec; covers all currently-used widths |
| `boolean` | Single-byte `0x00` / `0x01` |
| `Vector[T, N]` | Fixed-length list |
| `List[T, N]` | Variable-length list with cap `N` and mix-in-length root |
| `Bitvector[N]` | Fixed-length bit array |
| `Bitlist[N]` | Variable-length bit array with trailing-`1` delimiter |
| `Container` | Heterogeneous record / struct — every consensus container is one of these |

### SSZ types deliberately *not* implemented

These forms appear in the SSZ spec but are not used by any
consensus-spec fork through Gloas, so the library omits them
to keep the core proof obligation small:

| Type | Source | Status here |
|---|---|---|
| `Union[T₁, …, Tₙ]` | core SSZ spec | unimplemented — no fork uses it |
| `ProgressiveContainer(active_fields=[…])` | EIP-7495 | unimplemented — no fork adopted EIP-7495 |
| `StableContainer[N]` + `Profile` | EIP-7495 (legacy form) | unimplemented |
| `ProgressiveList[T]` / `ProgressiveBitlist` | EIP-7916 | unimplemented |
| `CompatibleUnion({sel: type, …})` | EIP-8016 | unimplemented |

ARCHITECTURE.md §8 carries the recipe for reintroducing any of
these the day a fork adopts them — they slot back into `SSZType`
as new constructors without disrupting the existing layers.

### Track in progress

**Phase 5 formal-verification widening** — the three central
theorems (roundtrip, non-malleability, size bound) are landed on
the narrow `BasicSupported` cut; widening to a universal statement
over `Supported` is the open work. The library itself is
complete; this track only closes the proof obligation.

See [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) for the staged roadmap and
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design
contract.

## Dependencies

### Lean-level

* `LeanSha256` — sibling subpackage, pure-Lean SHA-256 reference
  (used by the kernel-reducible `Hasher.Sha256Spec` instance).
  Pulled in transitively via the umbrella's
  [`lake-manifest.json`](../../lake-manifest.json).

### System-level (build-time native deps)

The production `Hasher.Sha256` instance is an FFI shim
(`csrc/sha256_shim.c`) that links to **OpenSSL 3.x**. Lake
discovers the right link flags via `pkg-config --libs libcrypto`
at build time, so the same `lake build` works on Debian/Ubuntu
multiarch, Fedora `/usr/lib64`, Arch, Alpine, macOS Homebrew
(where `openssl@3` is keg-only), and NixOS store paths — pkg-
config does the platform discrimination for us. If `pkg-config`
itself isn't installed, the build falls back to the hardcoded
Debian-multiarch values, which keeps existing `apt`-only
environments working.

You need two system packages:

* **OpenSSL 3.x development files** — both the shared library
  (`libcrypto.so.3` / `libcrypto.3.dylib` / …) and the headers
  (`<openssl/evp.h>`).
* **`pkg-config`** — the canonical Unix discovery tool the build
  uses to find the above.

| Platform | One-liner |
|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu | `sudo apt install libssl-dev pkg-config` |
| Fedora / RHEL   | `sudo dnf install openssl-devel pkgconf-pkg-config` |
| Arch            | `sudo pacman -S openssl pkgconf` |
| Alpine          | `sudo apk add openssl-dev pkgconf` |
| macOS (Homebrew) | `brew install openssl@3 pkg-config` |
| NixOS           | add `openssl pkg-config` to your `shell.nix` / `flake.nix` |

To verify your machine is set up — both system deps and the Lean
toolchain — run from the umbrella root:

```bash
just doctor         # checks pkg-config + OpenSSL + elan/lake/lean + uv/python3
just doctor-native  # checks only pkg-config + OpenSSL (the CI gate)
```

`just doctor` prints actionable platform-specific install hints if
anything's missing. The CI `test` and `conformance` jobs run
`just doctor-native` as their first step.

### Why a procedural lakefile

The FFI shim build (`csrc/sha256_shim.c` + `csrc/sha256_batch.c`)
needs a `target … : FilePath := do …` step that the declarative
`lakefile.toml` syntax can't express. The procedural `lakefile.lean`
also hosts the `pkg-config` discovery (a `BaseIO` call at lakefile-
load time via `unsafeBaseIO`); both reasons keep this subpackage on
`lakefile.lean` even though the umbrella and the two sibling
subpackages stay on declarative TOML.

## Module overview

* `Spec/` — `SSZType` universe, `interp`, `serialize`,
  `deserialize`, `hashTreeRoot`. The verified core.
* `Repr/` — the `SSZRepr` typeclass + deriving handler.
* `Hasher/` — abstract `Hasher` typeclass; `Sha256` (FFI) +
  `Sha256Spec` (pure-Lean) instances; `Sha256Equiv` (the named
  equivalence axiom).
* `Cache/` — `TreeBacked` / `UncachedSSZ` / `SSZ.Box` types,
  `sszUpdate` macro, Merkle-tree machinery.
* `Proofs/` — central proof artefacts and `@[ssz_simp]` set.
* `Conformance/` — SSZ-library property-test gates (Sha256
  vectors, hasher equivalence, `setAt` randomised tests, cache
  machinery on example containers).

## Build / test

```bash
just doctor                 # one-time sanity check on a fresh machine
lake build SizzLean         # compile the library
```

`just doctor` is the first thing to run on a new clone — it verifies
OpenSSL 3.x and `pkg-config` are present (the build-time native deps
the FFI shim links against, see [Dependencies](#dependencies)) plus
the Lean toolchain (elan / lake / lean) and the Python harness
toolchain (python3 / uv) used by the conformance recipes below. A
failed check prints the install command for your platform.

Three test surfaces, all driven from the umbrella `just` interface
at the repo root. The first two are quick; the third runs against
the downloaded upstream archive.

```bash
# SizzLean-internal property tests (Sha256 vectors, hasher
# equivalence, randomised setAt, cache coherence, sszUpdate cases —
# all fire as native_decide examples at build time)
just test-ssz

# Full NIST CAVP SHA-256 vectors — 129 byte-oriented cases
# (lives in the sibling LeanSha256 package, ~108s of native_decide)
just test-sha256

# Upstream `ethereum/consensus-spec-tests` — drives the Lean CLI
# against the official archives. A tqdm progress bar shows live
# per-case throughput. Quick sample:
just official-ssz-vector-tests
# Full `ssz_generic` sweep (~2188 in-scope cases, a couple of
# seconds — 292 progressive-container cases are out of scope):
just official-ssz-vector-tests-generic-full
# Full `ssz_static` sweep on mainnet preset (1585 cases, ~2 min):
just official-ssz-vector-tests-static-full
# Full upstream corpus: generic + static-full on mainnet preset:
just official-ssz-vector-tests-all
```

For the full menu, the protocol the harness uses, and how to
write code that targets `SSZ.FastBox` (production cache) or
`SSZ.PureBox` (proof-friendly uncached) on a *single* spec body,
see [`MANUAL.md`](MANUAL.md).

## Requiring this package

`SizzLean` lives as a subpackage of the [`etheorem` umbrella
repository](https://github.com/etheorem/etheorem). To depend on it
from another Lake project, add a `[[require]]` block to your
`lakefile.toml`:

```toml
[[require]]
name = "SizzLean"
git = "https://github.com/etheorem/etheorem"
subDir = "packages/SizzLean"
rev = "main"  # pin to a specific commit hash for reproducible builds
```

Then run `lake update` to refresh `lake-manifest.json`. Per the
umbrella's [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) dependency policy, prefer
pinning `rev` to a specific commit hash over tracking a branch once
you've validated a working pair — branch-tracking turns every
upstream change into a silent dep bump.

`SizzLean`'s only build-time dependency outside Lean core is the
sibling [`LeanSha256`](../LeanSha256) subpackage in the same umbrella;
adding the `[[require]]` above transitively pulls it in via the
umbrella's `lake-manifest.json`.
