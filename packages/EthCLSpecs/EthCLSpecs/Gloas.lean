# `EthCLSpecs.Gloas`: the Gloas fork (EIP-7732 ePBS), a diff over Fulu

`fork Gloas from Fulu` plus the ePBS container diff, the `upgradeToGloas`
lifecycle entry, and the fork-interface instance. Pinned to the v1.7.0-alpha.10
spec shape (the conformance vectors' version). The transition spine, operations,
and fork choice are inherited from / diffed over Fulu as that port matures.
