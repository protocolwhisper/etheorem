# `EthCLSpecs.Gloas.Withdrawals`: the EIP-7732 builder-aware withdrawal sweep

Gloas reshapes `process_withdrawals` (EIP-7732). It takes no payload, returns early
when the parent block carried no payload, and draws withdrawals from four sources in
order: the builder pending-withdrawal queue, the validator pending-partial queue, a
builder balance sweep, and the validator balance sweep. Each phase threads the
running list so the shared `MAX_WITHDRAWALS_PER_PAYLOAD` cap composes (the first
three reserve one slot for the validator sweep). The applied set is committed to
`payload_expected_withdrawals` for the later envelope check, and balances are
decremented on builders or validators per the index's builder flag.
