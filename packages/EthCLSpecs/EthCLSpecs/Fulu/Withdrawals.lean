# `EthCLSpecs.Fulu.Withdrawals`: the withdrawal sweep and `process_withdrawals`

`get_expected_withdrawals` (the Electra pending-partial queue followed by the
validator balance sweep) and `process_withdrawals` (assert the payload's
withdrawals match the expected set, apply them, advance the sweep bookkeeping).
The withdrawal predicates (`is_fully_withdrawable_validator`,
`is_partially_withdrawable_validator`, `is_eligible_for_partial_withdrawals`) are
pure functions of a validator and its post-sweep balance.
