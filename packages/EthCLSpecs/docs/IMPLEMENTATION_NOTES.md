# EthCLSpecs: Implementation Notes

The as-built companion to the four design documents in this directory
(`SPEC_AUTHORING_MODEL.md`, `SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FRAMEWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md`, and
the glossary). Those four are the design of record. This file records how
`EthCLSpecs` / `EthCLLib` realize them: the current architecture, the places the code
deviates from a doc (with the reason), and the spec-faithfulness decisions worth
knowing. Everything here describes the tree as it stands against the
`v1.7.0-alpha.10` pin.

## Scope and conformance

Two forks, **Fulu** and **Gloas**, against the `consensus-spec-tests` minimal and
mainnet archives at `v1.7.0-alpha.10` (the latest release with cut vectors; it is
flagged pre-release, so the harness pins the tag explicitly rather than reading `gh
release latest`). The full in-scope suite is green at both presets for both forks,
`--subset=0`, zero failures and zero `xfail`:

| | minimal | mainnet |
|---|---|---|
| Fulu  | **760 passed** | **667 passed** |
| Gloas | **903 passed** | **792 passed** |

Fulu's collected formats: `epoch_processing`, `operations` (including the standalone
`execution_payload`), `rewards`, `sanity/blocks`, `sanity/slots`, `finality`,
`random`, `fork_choice` (including the PeerDAS data-availability `on_block` cases and
`get_proposer_head`). Gloas adds `fork`, `transition`, and the full ePBS
`fork_choice`. `DISCREPANCIES.md` is empty of open discrepancies: every vector the
implemented formats reach matches by root or rejects faithfully.

**Out of scope** (deselected in `walk_cases`, not collected):

- **Fulu `fork` / `transition`** (Electra→Fulu): the upgrade and the pre-fork Electra
  blocks both need a complete Electra parent fork the library never builds. The
  **Gloas** `fork` / `transition` (Fulu→Gloas) are in scope and green.
- **`ssz_static`**: covered by SizzLean's own tests and the build-time `deriving
  SSZRepr` gates.
- **`light_client`, `networking`, `merkle_proof`, `sync`**: not state-transition or
  fork-choice formats; outside `IN_SCOPE_RUNNERS`.
- **`genesis`**: no vectors at the pin (see Genesis below).

**CI.** The `ethcl` job in `lean_action_ci.yml` runs `just ethcl-test` (builds all
four libraries, firing the framework and spec self-tests) and `just
ethcl-pyspec-smoke` (the `pytest-xdist` dev subset at minimal for both forks
through the per-worker `pyspec_server`). It is green iff no in-scope vector hits a
bug-smell or a real mismatch. Mainnet and the full sweep run on demand
(`--preset=mainnet`, `--subset=0`).

## Inheritance and capture

The capture/replay mechanism lives in `EthCLLib.Internal.Capture` (two
`SimplePersistentEnvExtension`s: `lineageExt` for `fork … from …` edges, `captureExt`
for the raw declaration bodies) and `EthCLLib.Spec.Forms` (the `fork` / `forkdef` /
`inherit` command elaborators). `inherit Foo` walks `lineageExt` from the current
namespace strictly upward and replays the nearest ancestor's captured `Foo` by
re-emitting a `def` with the bare short name in the current namespace. The body is the
author's own un-stamped syntax, spliced by quotation, so its sibling identifiers
late-bind at the child site by ordinary name resolution. Antiquoting pre-existing
syntax adds no macro scopes, so no blanket hygiene override is needed.

- **The `fork` keyword reserves the token `fork`.** A `scoped syntax "fork " …` makes
  `fork` a keyword in every module that opens `EthCLLib.Spec`, so a binding named
  `fork` fails to parse. The captured-declaration field is `forkNs`, and elaborators
  use `forkNs` locals. Spec authors must not name a binding `fork`.
- **`fork` identity is the current namespace; the parent is the sibling.** `fork Gloas
  from Fulu` records `(currNamespace, currNamespace.getPrefix ++ Fulu)`, which assumes
  both forks share a prefix (`EthCLSpecs.Fulu`, `EthCLSpecs.Gloas`), as
  `SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.4 mandates. The `Name` argument is documentation; identity
  comes from the namespace.
- **`inherit` is a pure consumer** and never re-captures, so a grandchild walks past an
  unchanged intermediate fork to the nearest ancestor that captured the symbol.
- **Gloas re-declares Fulu's unchanged component containers with `inherit`**
  (`Gloas.Inherited`, 28 types in dependency order: `Checkpoint`, `Validator`,
  `Attestation`, the slashing / deposit / exit evidence, the sync structures, the
  pending-queue records) rather than reaching across the fork boundary for them. Each
  replays Fulu's field block in the `EthCLSpecs.Gloas` namespace, so `Gloas.Validator` is
  a fresh structure with Fulu's exact fields, hence Fulu's exact SSZ encoding and Merkle
  root, and the fork is a complete, flat namespace (`SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.4). The
  price falls at the upgrade boundary: `upgradeToGloas` converts each Fulu component value
  to its Gloas twin field-by-field (`cvValidator`, `cvCheckpoint`, …, with SizzLean's
  `SSZList.mapCap` for the list-typed fields), since `Gloas.Validator` is a distinct type from
  `Fulu.Validator`. Dependency order (a field's type inherited before the container that
  uses it), `open EthCLSpecs.Fulu` for the constants and aliases, and current-namespace
  priority for the types together make each replayed body bind its siblings to the
  Gloas-local copy. A plain `def` that the capture mechanism can't replay (`addressOf`) is
  restated for the Gloas validator, the same way `balanceAfterWithdrawals` is. `inherit`
  creating a fresh type is also the right tool for declarations a fork genuinely changes
  (`BeaconState`, `BeaconBlockBody`).

## Container and struct macros

`forkcontainer` (`Forms.lean` `emitContainer`) derives `Inhabited`, `DecidableEq`,
`BEq`, `Ord`, `Hashable`, and `SizzLean.SSZRepr`. `forkstruct` (`emitStruct`) is the
plain-structure variant. It also captures and replays arbitrary bracketed binders, so
a parameterized `forkstruct Store (map : MapKind) [HasherTag]` (with the auto
`[Preset]` first) is expressible. Both take `declModifiers` so a `/-- … -/` docstring
can precede them without derailing the parse, and both emit the `deriving` in a
*separate* `deriving instance … for` command. `Forms.lean` `import SizzLean`, so the
class names resolve as globals rather than hygiene-stamped `SizzLean.SSZRepr✝`.

`Ord` / `Hashable` derive universally now that SizzLean carries them for the collection
types (`SSZList` / `Bitvector` / `Bitlist`), so the design docs' §5 "every container"
wording holds and a map-key container (`Checkpoint`) needs no hand-written derive. The
Gloas `ForkChoiceNode` is a `forkstruct` (no SSZ derive), so it keeps its own
`deriving instance BEq, Inhabited for …`. `Root`-keyed maps still need an explicit
`Ord (Vector UInt8 32)` (`instOrdBytes32` in `Fulu/ForkChoice.lean`) for `MapKind`.

`forkstruct`'s bracketed-binder capture has two practical notes the fork-choice structs
rely on: `emitStruct` puts `[Preset]` first then the extra binders (so `Store map`
resolves with `map` the only explicit parameter), and it emits no `deriving`, so a
struct's `Inhabited` (and the map-key `Ord` / `BEq` / `Hashable`) is added by a
following `deriving instance … for …`.

## Crypto seam

`EthCLLib.Spec.Crypto` defines `CryptoBackend` (BLS `verify` / `fastAggregateVerify` /
`ethFastAggregateVerify` / `aggregatePubkeys`, KZG `kzgVerifyCellProofBatch`) over raw
`ByteArray` of the wire sizes (sk 32, pubkey 48, signature 96, blob 131072, commitment
48, cell 2048, proof 48). The class carries no SSZ dependency. `aggregatePubkeys` is a
deterministic aggregation rather than a verify gate, so it is its own member.

The single-value wire conversion is a coercion. SizzLean provides
`CoeOut (Vector UInt8 n) ByteArray` (`Repr/Instances.lean`, the canonical `⟨v.toArray⟩`),
so a `Root` / pubkey / signature is usable wherever the seam wants `ByteArray` with nothing
written at the call site. `CoeOut` is the source-keyed coercion class (the same one core
Lean uses for `Fin n → Nat`); a plain `Coe` fails here because its source is a semi-out-param
and the parametric `Vector UInt8 ?n` leaves a metavariable. The conversion fires for function
arguments, `++`, and `!=`, which covers the hashing concatenations and the fork-choice root
checks. It deliberately does not lift through `Array`, so a pubkey/commitment set keeps an
explicit `.map vecToBytes`; and the reverse direction (`bytesToVec` / `bytesToRoot`) stays an
explicit function, since it picks a length and truncates.

The spec does not call the seam directly. It calls the vector-typed wrappers: `blsVerify` /
`blsFastAggregateVerify` / `blsEthFastAggregateVerify` / `blsAggregatePubkeys` in `Crypto`
(beside the seam), and `blsVerifySigned` in `SigningRoot` (it folds in `computeSigningRoot`,
so it lives beside the helper it composes; `SigningRoot` imports `Crypto` for `blsVerify`).
Each is a thin definitional wrapper, so a wrapper call reduces to the exact seam call it
replaces. The KZG batch is called inline (its arguments are different-width vector arrays).
A gate then reads `assert (blsVerifySigned pubkey obj domain sig)`, naming the values, with
the wire-byte conversion out of the spec body.

Four backends: `ffi` (production), `verifyOff` (`bls_setting: 2`, BLS gated, KZG kept
real), `symbolic` (proofs; returns a zero 48-byte point for aggregation, never
executed), and `caching`. `caching` memoizes BLS `verify`, the repeated hot path, keyed
by the exact `(pubkey, message, signature)` wire bytes behind an `@[implemented_by]`
swap: the logical definition stays the `ffi` primitive (transparency is `rfl`, in
`Spec/Crypto.lean`), and only the compiled code consults the global memo. The runner
injects `caching`. `CryptoBackend.forBlsSetting blsSetting` is the single home for the
per-case selection (`2` → `verifyOff`, else the real backend), so a `PySpecTests` entry
point writes `CryptoBackend.forBlsSetting cmeta.blsSetting` rather than re-spelling the test.

- **Backends are `@[reducible]`.** A `def` whose result type is a class trips a lint
  unless reducible, and reducibility is what lets `native_decide` reduce the record to
  expose the FFI calls. The hasher tags (`fastHasherTag` / `pureHasherTag`) carry it
  too.
- **Inject by `@`, not a named instance argument.** `[CryptoBackend]` is an anonymous
  instance binder, so a call site picks the backend with `@f CryptoBackend.ffi …` or
  `letI`, not `(CryptoBackend := …)`.

The sync-aggregate participant set is computed one way: the bit-selected committee
pubkeys are passed to `ethFastAggregateVerify`, which aggregates whatever list it is
given. This matches the spec result for all three of its cases (all-participate,
majority-subtract, full list) and keeps the seam to `ethFastAggregateVerify` alone,
with no G1 add/neg and no precomputed-aggregate dependency.

## State, presets, and the header macro

`State` is the boxed `SSZ.Box _ BeaconState`. Hashing runs through the `[HasherTag]`
seam (`sha`). The `Preset` / `Config` / `Const` three-tier constant system carries the
per-fork values; the fork interfaces are preset-parameterized (`fuluInterfaceFor (P :
Preset) (C : Config)`, `gloasInterfaceFor (P) (C) (forkVersion)`) so `minimal` and
`mainnet` instances coexist (the preset is a parameter, not a global instance), and the
runner selects fork × preset (`pyspec_server [fork] [preset]`).

- **The section header is two macros: `state_preamble` declares, `state_section` opens.**
  The split follows the seam that declarations persist across modules while `variable`s
  do not. `state_preamble BeaconState` runs once in the `State` module and declares
  `abbrev State` plus the concrete-domain `modifyState` (`State → State`); `state_section`
  opens each operation file's `section` and re-establishes the
  `[Preset] [HasherTag] [Config] [CryptoBackend]` selectors plus the monad /
  `MonadStateOf` / `MonadExceptOf` line (`[Config]` / `[CryptoBackend]` are
  instance-implicit, so they attach only to the substeps that use them). Because `State` is declared
  once in a module everyone imports, the declaration is unconditional and needs no guard;
  the variables re-emit per file because they do not persist. The fork-choice counterpart
  is `fork_choice_section map`, which emits the same selectors plus the store variables
  (`{map} [FcMap map]`, `MonadStateOf (Store map)`).
- **`modifyState` carries no binder annotation.** Its concrete `State → State` domain (the
  preamble emits it per fork, since `State` is per-fork) flows the expected type into a
  step's lambda, so `modifyState fun state => …` types `state : State` with no
  `(state : State)`. A generic framework `modifyState` could not do this: its `S` would
  be a metavariable when the `sszUpdate` macro in the body fires.

## State access, indexing, and the error model

Reads and writes go through `sszGet` / `sszUpdate`. The index accessor is chosen by three
questions: is the index *load-bearing* (data-derived and not otherwise bounded), has a
validation already proved it in range, and is a reject channel in scope (a monadic step or
an `Except` query) at the read.

- **A data-derived index with a reject channel** uses `sszGetIdx` / `bitlistGetIdx`
  (`Spec/State.lean`), which build an `Except IndexError` and hand it to `liftErr`,
  surfacing `outOfBounds i xs.size` with the real index and bound (the audit's `likelyBug`
  bucket) rather than masking as a default. This covers the operation reads in a state step
  (`process_attestation`'s participation reads, `process_withdrawal_request`'s balance read,
  the pending-consolidation source reads) and the pure queries that return `Except IndexError`
  because their index is untrusted or a parameter (`get_base_reward`, `get_attesting_indices`,
  the reward-delta helpers), whose monadic callers bind them through `liftErr`.
- **An index a spec validation checks** is read through `assertH (i < size)`
  (`Spec/Assert.lean`): the assert returns the witness, so the read is the proof-carrying,
  reject-free `vs[i]'h.down`, with no default fallback, the bad index having rejected at the
  `assertH`. Plain `assert` stays the Unit-returning form for validations whose proof nothing
  downstream needs. `process_voluntary_exit`, `process_proposer_slashing`, the block-header
  proposer read, and the Gloas withdrawal sweep take this form, ten sites in all.
- **A structurally-bounded index** uses the total bang `vs[i]!` / `vget v i`, or `vmodGet`
  for a `% LEN` ring-buffer read (proof-carrying via the preset length bound). The index is
  provably in range, a `Fin n` iterating a length-`n` vector, a `for i in [0:xs.size]` loop,
  or a constant, so an out-of-range value is impossible. Making the still-total ones
  proof-carrying is the residual recorded in `FUTURE_WORK.md`.
- **A data-derived index in a pure query with no reject channel and a valid-by-construction
  index** reads total `vs[i]!`, resting on the invariant the query assumes (validators /
  balances / participation share a length; the input is well-formed). `getWeight`,
  `computeCommittee`, and the builder-registry queries keep this shape. Making it reject
  means either an `Except` return, when the index is genuinely untrusted (the first case
  above), or the proof-carrying form once the length invariants are proved (`FUTURE_WORK.md`).

`vs[i]?` is the faithful option read (`none` past the end); the `GetElem` instance uses
the real validity `i < vs.size`, so `vs[i]!` and `vs[i]?` behave like `Array`'s.

An `SSZList` carries its own collection surface, so spec bodies stay off the subtype's
`.val` projection. `vs.size`, `vs.foldl`, `vs.map`, `vs.any`, `vs.all`, `vs.findIdx?`,
`vs.contains`, `vs.toList`, and `for x in vs` read the list directly. `vs.toArray` hands
back the underlying `Array` for the operations the surface does not cover (`.filter`,
`.qsort`, or passing the buffer to an `Array`-typed helper). `Bitlist` mirrors the list:
`bits[i]!` / `bits[i]?` read a bit, `bits.size` the length. These live in SizzLean
(`Repr/Instances.lean`), next to `SSZList` itself.

`outOfBounds` carries the real index and bound: `sszGetIdx` reads the underlying array,
builds SizzLean's `IndexError (idx, bound)` (a payload-carrying constructor) on a miss, and
hands it to `liftErr`, which converts it to the context monad's reject via `[ErrorConv
IndexError E]`, reporting `i` / `size` directly. Decode failures no longer borrow
`outOfBounds`: deserializing a vector's bytes is the runner's job, not the spec's, so an
`Interface` deserializer's `.error` becomes `RunError.decode` (the runner error type below),
not a fabricated index.

`StoreTransitionError.missingKey` carries the 32-byte root (`Vector UInt8 32`).
`StateTransitionError` and `StoreTransitionError` classify by constructor into the
driver's pass / expected-rejection / out-of-scope / bug-smell buckets.

`RunError E` (`EthCLLib/Spec/Errors.lean`) is the runner-level error one layer above a spec
reject: `decode what` is a wire-deserialization failure (always a bug-smell, a well-formed
vector decodes), `spec e` carries a spec reject of type `E` through unchanged. Every
`ForkInterface` method returns `Except (RunError …) …`; `RunError.classify` (via the
`Classify` class over the two spec error types) sends `decode → likelyBug` and
`spec e → e.classify`, and `RunError.ofSpec` lifts a spec-level `Except` into it once a
method leaves decoding and runs spec code. This removed the old decode hacks (the
`outOfBounds 0 0` fabrication on the state path and the `assert "… decode failed"` on the
fork-choice anchor path), so a decode failure is named for what it is and never masquerades
as a consensus reject.

**Element writes: infallible `[i]!` vs checked `[i]`.** SizzLean's `sszUpdate` element
index comes in two forms. The checked `field[i] := v` is *fallible* (`Except
IndexError`, matching the pyspec's `IndexError`), for a write that should reject an
out-of-range index. The bang `field[i]! := v` is *total*: it returns the bare `State`,
an out-of-range write being a silent no-op that mirrors `Array.set!`, and it emits the
same spine address and root as the checked form. The reset / caching writes
(`process_slot`'s root caching, the slashings / randao resets, the builder-payment
slots) key an index that is in range by construction (`idx = … % VECTOR_LENGTH`), so
they use `field[i]!`: total (it fits the `modifyState fun state => State` contexts with
no reject path) and, for the composite-element fields (`Vector Bytes32`, the
builder-payment vector), the cached O(log n) single-leaf update rather than an O(field)
rebuild. Both forms work over a preset-resolved (symbolic) cap (the derive's
`capToShapeSyntax` mirror in SizzLean).

**Root caching: `getStateRoot` threads the warm box.** `Box.hashTreeRoot` returns
`(root, warm-box)`, the warm box holding the committed intermediate-node tree, so taking
a root is `modifyGet`-shaped. `getStateRoot` (`Spec/State.lean`) is the primitive that
encapsulates it: it reads the boxed state, takes the root, and writes the warm box back
through `MonadState`, so a later root reuses the tree instead of rebuilding it. It pins
the state type `S` from the section's `MonadState S m` (the state type is an `outParam`),
then recovers the box through the `StateRoot` class, so the box's hasher and value type
need not be inferred as metavariables. The `state_transition` spine and the monadic
interface folds call it. The non-monadic sites use the pure `stateRoot` (root plus warm
box, `Spec/State.lean`), which keeps spec bodies off `Box.hashTreeRoot`: `process_slot`
calls it inside its `Id.run` block, since it needs both halves while it keeps mutating,
and `onExecutionPayloadEnvelope` calls it and returns the warm box, which the handler
stores back into `blockStates`. The pure `stateRoot!` (`Spec/State.lean`) is the discard
form, its `!` marking that it drops the warm box (the convenient-but-lossy variant, like
`Array.get!`). It is reserved for the terminal `Interface` sites, where the root is the
function's return value and the box dies with the call. Whether retention actually caches
is the box flavour's call (a cached box keeps the tree, a pure box does not), so the spec
threads unconditionally and the runner picks the flavour. Memory: the warm tree scales with state size, so at mainnet under high
`pytest-xdist` parallelism the retained trees can exhaust memory and crash workers; the
runner caps `-n` accordingly (mainnet runs at `-n 4`, Gloas mainnet at `-n 2`, until
per-test cleanup lands). That is a runner concern, not a reason to drop the threading
from the spec.

`CaseRequest` renames the pyspec metadata field to `caseMeta`, since `meta` is a
section-modifier keyword that fails to project.

## Authoring conventions

State binders are readable. The threaded state is `state`; where a step's previous state
is not reused, the next binding shadows it (`fun state => Id.run do let mut state :=
state`). Where a `← get` snapshot is read alongside a separate mutable (so two bindings
are live at once), the snapshot keeps `state` and the mutable is `stateAcc`. Element reads
spell out `validator` / `builder`, and the domain abbreviations are expanded:
`latestHeader`, `committeesPerSlot`, `epochsPerVector`, `indexedAttestation`,
`pendingDeposit`, `builderIndex`, `randomBytes`, `syncCommittee`, `prevStateRoot`. The
runner-glue binders follow suit: a post-state is `post`, the fork-choice interpreter's
threaded store is `storeAcc` / `store'`. The terse names that stay are the ones
`SPEC_AUTHORING_MODEL.md` §2.3 does not target: a loop index `i`, a type variable (`H`),
the monad variable, the `acc` of a fold, and one-line record-update callbacks
(`fun b => { b with … }`) whose binder is obvious within its single line.

Spec bodies carry a single `open EthCLLib.Spec`. The module re-exports the SSZ
collection vocabulary (`export SizzLean.Repr (SSZList Bitvector Bitlist)`, plus the
byte / collection / hasher helpers), so a pure spec body needs nothing more (Gloas adds
`open EthCLSpecs.Fulu` for the shared constants and primitive aliases; its component
*types* are inherited into the Gloas namespace, not opened from Fulu). The residual `open SizzLean.Cache` /
`Hasher` survive only in the interface / fork-choice / upgrade glue, which name the box
representation (`SSZ.Box` / `Sha256` / `HasherTag`) directly; re-exporting those into
the author surface would defeat the `sszGet` / `sszUpdate` encapsulation.

## Module layout

**EthCLLib** (`SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.6). §3.6 sketches an `EthCLLib/Forms/{…}` tree
that names concerns rather than a mandated layout. The realized layout is finer: the
author surface under `EthCLLib/Spec/` (`Arith`, `Assert`, `Crypto`, `Errors`,
`FiniteMap`, `Forms`, `Hasher`, `Header`, `Loop`, `SigningRoot`, `State`, aggregated by
`Spec.lean`), the pyspec driver under `EthCLLib/PySpecTests/` (`Driver`,
`Interface`), and the capture base under `EthCLLib/Internal/` (`Capture`). The §3.6
concerns map on: `Preset` / `Monad` / `Box` → `Spec.State` + `Spec.Header`; `Map` →
`Spec.FiniteMap`; `Crypto` / `Arith` / `Loop` → the same-named `Spec.*`; `Interface` /
`PySpecTests` → `PySpecTests.Interface` + `PySpecTests.Driver`. The names `FiniteMap` /
`Errors` / `Header` read better than the sketch, so §3.6 is reconciled by this mapping.

`Spec.Arith` carries `umax` / `umin` / `isqrt`, type-directed `uintToBytes`, byte
conversions, `vget`, `vecSliceEq` (fixed-window byte-slice equality), `vmodGet` /
`umodIdx` (ring-buffer read / write index), `sszDrop` / `sszOfArray`, `bitGet` / `bitSet`,
and `hasFlag` / `addFlag`. The cap-clamping append moved to SizzLean (`SSZList.push`,
with `sszAppend` / `appendState` on top), so the old `sszPush` is gone. `Spec.State`
carries `getStateRoot` / `stateRoot` / `stateRoot!` and `runToRoot` (run a boxed-state
action to its post-root, the `EStateM` twin of `runOn`). `Spec.SigningRoot` carries
`htr`, `computeForkDataRoot`, `computeDomain`, `computeSigningRoot`, `isValidMerkleBranch`,
and the signing-root verify combinator `blsVerifySigned`, over `[HasherTag]`. `Spec.Loop`
carries `Step` / `fuelLoop` (monadic) / `fuelIterate` (pure walk). `Spec.FiniteMap` carries
`MapKind`, `FcMap` (with `lookupD` / `getOrThrow` / `getOrThrowKey` / `values` /
`filterKeys`), `treeMap`, `hashMap`, and `Hashable (Vector …)`.

**EthCLSpecs** is split by concern within each fork (`SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.1); no
`Helpers` / `Base` / `Misc` / `Util` catch-all exists. Fulu component containers are
one file each under `Fulu/Containers/` in topological order (`Fork`, `Checkpoint`,
`Validator`, `Eth1Data`, `BeaconBlockHeader`, `Sync`, `Execution`, `Deposit`,
`PendingOps`, `Withdrawal`); `Containers.lean` re-exports them; `BeaconState` is its own
`Fulu/State.lean`; the block-body / attestation / execution-payload containers stay in
`Fulu/Blocks.lean`. Pure-on-`Validator` predicates (`isActiveValidator`,
`isSlashableValidator`, `isEligibleForActivationQueue`, the credential predicates,
`getMaxEffectiveBalance`) sit in `Containers/Validator`; `isEligibleForActivation` reads
the finalized checkpoint, so it lives in the operation layer.

The Fulu operation layer, by concern in load order: `Time` (epoch/slot conversions,
`computeActivationExitEpoch`, the pure `currentEpochOf` / `previousEpochOf`), `Signing`
(`getDomain`), `Randao`, `Balances`, `Registry` (the read accessors), `Committees`
(with `getBeaconProposerIndex`), `Accessors` (the derived float-ups
`getTotalActiveBalance`, `getUnslashedParticipatingIndices`, block-root reads,
`getPendingBalanceToWithdraw`), `RegistryUpdates` (churn limits, the lifecycle mutators
`initiateValidatorExit` / `slashValidator`, the consolidation / compounding mutators,
`modValidator`, and `isEligibleForActivation`), `Rewards`, `Deposits`. `Committees`,
`Withdrawals`, `EpochProcessing`, `Operations`, `Transition`, `ForkChoice` round it out.

**The read/write seam** (§3.3) splits the Registry concern across the `Committees` row:
the read accessors (`getActiveValidatorIndices`) sit below `Committees` in `Registry`
(because `getBeaconCommittee` needs the active set), the mutators (`slashValidator`) sit
above it in `RegistryUpdates` (because `slashValidator` calls `getBeaconProposerIndex`).
The derived `getTotalActiveBalance` straddles `Balances` and `Registry`, so it floats up
into `Accessors`. This is a split by concern forced by the seam, not a by-kind
`Accessors.lean` / `Mutators.lean` grouping. §3.2's tiny-concern merge allows the
single-predicate `Predicates` row (`isEligibleForActivation`) to fold into
`RegistryUpdates`.

**Naming.** The runner is *PySpecTests* on both sides: the Lean exe at
`EthCLSpecs/PySpecTests/Server.lean` (the `lean_exe` root), the Python harness at the
package-level `packages/EthCLSpecs/PySpecTests/`. Test libraries are `EthCLLib/Tests/`
and `EthCLSpecs/Tests/` (namespaces `EthCLLib.Tests.*` / `EthCLSpecs.Tests.*`), each its
own `lean_lib`, excluded from the shipped library for free (Lake's default lib glob is
`roots.map Glob.one`, so the main lib never reaches `Tests/`). The
`packages/<Pkg>/<Pkg>/` doubling is forced by namespace-equals-library-name.

The per-fork `ForkInterface` instance and its decode / run glue (`fuluInterfaceFor`,
`stateRootImpl`, the dispatchers, `pyspecPinnedVersion`) live in
`EthCLSpecs.<Fork>.Interface` (`Fulu/Interface.lean`, `Gloas/Interface.lean`), a
sub-namespace kept out of the bare `EthCLSpecs.Fulu` / `EthCLSpecs.Gloas` spec namespace.
The interface is the seam to the pyspec harness, not consensus logic, so it does not
sit among the spec helpers; it reaches the spec's `forkdef`s through the enclosing fork
namespace, and the `Server` selects `EthCLSpecs.<Fork>.Interface.<fork>Interface`.

## Fork choice

Fork choice is the second monadic state machine (`SPEC_AUTHORING_MODEL.md` §3.2,
`FRAMEWORK_ARCHITECTURE.md` §6–7, §9). `Store` (with `map : MapKind` and `[HasherTag]`,
plus the auto `[Preset]`), `LatestMessage`, and the Gloas `ForkChoiceNode` are
`forkstruct`s. The section opens with `fork_choice_section map`; the handlers are `forkdef
on* : StoreTransition Unit` over the typed `StoreTransitionError`. They write the same
`assert` / `todo` the state machine uses (resolved to `StoreTransitionError` through
`SpecReject` from the section's monad), `missingKey` for `FcMap` misses, and the inner
`state_transition` runs through `runStateTransition` (`Spec/Assert.lean`, wrapping an inner
failure as `StoreTransitionError.transition`). Queries and transforms stay pure
`forkdef`s of the store. `ForkInterface.runForkChoice` returns `Except (RunError
StoreTransitionError) Unit`, and `Server` classifies the typed reject (`.spec (.todo _)
→ todo`, everything else, a `decode` or any other spec reject, `→ bug`), so no `"TODO:"`
string convention is involved. The `FcStep` wire
protocol the harness builds from `steps.yaml` carries the per-step block / attestation
files; a `block` step also feeds the block's own attestations and attester-slashings.

The interpreter does not own the valid/invalid policy. It runs each step to an `Except
StoreTransitionError (Store)` outcome (`runOn` projects the handler's `EStateM` result),
then pipes it through the framework `checkStepValidity before expectedValid outcome`,
which is the runner's per-step check, fork-agnostic over the store type. The snapshot is
the pre-step store (free, since stores are immutable values): a step expected valid that
succeeds threads its new store; one expected invalid that is rejected rolls back to the
snapshot and continues (the rejection is the expected result); the two mismatches, a valid
step rejected or an invalid step accepted, are returned as the run's failure (the first the
step's own error, the second a typed `assert`). The fork interpreters only run steps and
thread the store; the policy lives in `checkStepValidity`. A step that carries a `valid`
flag is `block`, the standalone `attestation` / `attester_slashing`, and in Gloas the
`execution_payload` envelope and `payload_attestation_message`; a step with no flag (`tick`,
the block's own `is_from_block` sub-attestations) is implicitly `valid := true`. The
harness then reports a returned error by its constructor (a `.todo` as out-of-scope, any
other as a bug-smell test failure). The `valid` flag on the standalone `attestation` /
`attester_slashing` steps matters for the `validate_on_attestation` vectors, where the wire
`valid: false` marks an attestation `on_attestation` is meant to reject.

`on_block` reads the current head before inserting the block and applies the proposer
boost only when the block is timely, no boost is already set, and the block shares the
head's dependent root (`get_dependent_root`, gated by `MIN_SEED_LOOKAHEAD`), the v1.7
rule.

The linear DAG walks (`getAncestor`, the `getHead` descent, `advanceStoreTime`) route
through the framework's pure `fuelIterate` (§12). The one tree walk, `filterBlockTree`,
recurses over every child inside a fold, which a linear combinator cannot express, so it
keeps a local fuel-bounded `where` helper. The totality the doc wants is met either way.

The Gloas fork choice is the node-based (`ForkChoiceNode = (root, payload_status)`)
ePBS rewrite: `get_ancestor` / `is_ancestor` / `get_weight` / `get_node_children` /
`get_head` thread the payload status, with the ePBS handlers
`on_execution_payload_envelope` (envelope verification) and
`on_payload_attestation_message` (PTC vote recording) and the payload-status / vote
checks; the `FcStep` protocol grows the envelope / PTC-message steps. EIP-7732 genuinely
differs here, so Gloas overrides most handlers rather than inheriting them, and the
`forkstruct` / `inherit` reuse pays off less than it does for the state transition.

## Fulu state transition

`Fulu/Transition.lean` is the spine: `process_slot` (cache state / block roots),
`process_slots` (with `process_epoch` at boundaries), `process_epoch` (the full Fulu
ordering), `process_block_header`, `process_randao`, `process_eth1_data`,
`process_sync_aggregate`, `process_execution_payload`, `process_block`,
`verify_block_signature`, `state_transition`. `Fulu/Withdrawals.lean` holds
`get_expected_withdrawals` (the EIP-7251 pending-partial queue then the Capella
validator sweep) and `process_withdrawals`. `Fulu/EpochProcessing.lean` holds every
`process_epoch` substep; `Fulu/Committees.lean` holds the swap-or-not shuffle and
everything built on it (`get_seed`, `compute_committee` / `get_beacon_committee`, the
balance-weighted sampler, `compute_proposer_indices` / `get_beacon_proposer_indices`,
`get_next_sync_committee`), pure functions of the boxed state. `getBeaconProposerIndex`
reads the precomputed `proposerLookahead` (Fulu EIP-7917), so the proposer needs no
runtime shuffle; only committees and building the lookahead / sync committee do.

Spec-faithfulness facts worth knowing:

- **`process_pending_deposits` resets `deposit_balance_to_consume` by stop reason.** An
  eth1-bridge / not-finalized / per-epoch-limit stop resets it to zero; a churn-limit
  stop carries `available_for_processing − processed_amount` forward. `ppdLoop` returns
  the `churnLimitReached` flag so the caller writes the right value.
- **`apply_pending_deposit` is signature-gated.** A new pubkey joins the registry only
  when `is_valid_deposit_signature` passes (the proof-of-possession the deposit contract
  does not check). The domain is fixed (`compute_domain(DOMAIN_DEPOSIT)`, genesis fork
  version, zero `genesis_validators_root`), so the check is one `[CryptoBackend].verify`.
- **`initiate_validator_exit` bounds the withdrawable epoch.** It asserts `exit_epoch +
  MIN_VALIDATOR_WITHDRAWABILITY_DELAY < 2^64` before the write, so an over-range case
  rejects faithfully (matching the pyspec's `uint64` serialization `ValueError`) instead
  of wrapping silently on Lean's `UInt64`. Valid exits never approach the bound. Gloas
  inherits the substep with no Gloas-side change.
- **`process_execution_payload` takes the execution engine as valid.** It checks
  parent-hash / prev-randao / timestamp consistency and caches the header;
  `verify_and_notify_new_payload` is the consumer's responsibility, which is valid for
  `sanity/blocks`. The timestamp uses `genesis_time + slot * SECONDS_PER_SLOT` (the
  pinned form), and the standalone `operations/execution_payload` format threads the
  test's `execution.yaml` engine verdict via `CaseMeta.executionValid` to model an
  engine rejection. The blob-parameter bound is enforced where the operation format
  supplies it. The skip is safe for the in-scope corpus by audit, not just by
  assumption: every invalid `sanity/blocks` / `finality` / `random` case (82, across
  both presets and both forks) rejects through a consensus `assert` the in-block
  pipeline models, signatures, blob-count limits, payload-attestation checks, the
  execution-requests root, slot / parent consistency, duplicate operations, the state
  root, so none reaches a clean run that an engine verdict alone would have rejected.
  An invalid block that depended on the engine verdict would run clean and surface as a
  `likelyBug` "expected a rejection but ran clean", not a silent pass.

`CryptoBackend.aggregatePubkeys` exists because `get_next_sync_committee` needs BLS
pubkey aggregation (the `ffi` / `verifyOff` backends delegate to
`LeanHazmat.Bls.ethAggregatePubkeys`; the `symbolic` backend returns a zero point).

## Gloas diff

`EthCLSpecs.Gloas` is `fork Gloas from Fulu` plus the EIP-7732 ePBS diff. The
`BeaconState` is the 46-field ePBS shape: `latestExecutionPayloadBid` replaces
`latestExecutionPayloadHeader`, `latestBlockHash` sits after `nextSyncCommittee`, and
the ePBS tail appends `builders`, `nextWithdrawalBuilderIndex`,
`executionPayloadAvailability`, `builderPendingPayments`, `builderPendingWithdrawals`,
`latestExecutionPayloadBid`, `payloadExpectedWithdrawals`, `ptcWindow`. The containers
are declared in-spec, tracking `specs/gloas/beacon-chain.md` (and `fork.md` for
`upgradeToGloas`). Gloas extends Fulu's three constant tiers with the
ePBS values: `ptcSize` / `maxBuildersPerWithdrawalsSweep` (preset);
`builderRegistryLimit` / `builderPendingWithdrawalsLimit` / `maxPayloadAttestations` /
the builder-payment threshold and builder prefixes and domains (universal); and
`gloasForkVersion` / `churnLimitQuotientGloas` / `consolidationChurnLimitQuotient` /
`maxPerEpochActivationChurnLimitGloas` / `minBuilderWithdrawabilityDelay` (config).

`upgradeToGloas` copies the carried-over fields, initializes the ePBS fields, builds the
PTC window from the Fulu pre-state's committees (`initialize_ptc_window` / `compute_ptc`,
called on the boxed Fulu state since the committee helpers are Fulu's), and onboards
builders from the pending-deposit queue (`onboard_builders_from_pending_deposits`). It
takes `GLOAS_FORK_VERSION` as a parameter and sets `fork := {previous :=
pre.fork.current, current := GLOAS_FORK_VERSION, epoch := currentEpoch}`.

**Epoch inheritance is the framework's reason to exist.** `Gloas.EpochProcessing`
`inherit`s the Fulu epoch substeps and their ~50 helper / time / RANDAO `forkdef`
dependencies verbatim. Each captured Fulu declaration re-elaborates in the Gloas
namespace against `Gloas.State`, sibling calls rebinding to the Gloas copies, no substep
body restated. EIP-7732 changes none of these substeps and `Gloas.BeaconState` carries
every field they read, so the replay typechecks and runs. A short module of `inherit`
statements turns the entire Fulu epoch transition into a green Gloas one; the `inherit`
order is the Fulu load order, so each body's dependencies are already in scope when it
replays.

The churn substeps are the exception: EIP-8061 gives Gloas its own
`CHURN_LIMIT_QUOTIENT_GLOAS` / `CONSOLIDATION_CHURN_LIMIT_QUOTIENT` /
`MAX_PER_EPOCH_ACTIVATION_CHURN_LIMIT_GLOAS`, so `getExitChurnLimit`,
`getActivationChurnLimit`, `getConsolidationChurnLimit`, `computeExitEpochAndUpdateChurn`,
and `processPendingDeposits` are Gloas `forkdef` overrides ahead of the inherited
exit / registry / consolidation handlers. The Fulu committee helpers are `forkdef`s
inherited into Gloas, which carries `process_sync_committee_updates`,
`process_proposer_lookahead`, the new `process_ptc_window`, the EIP-8045
slashed-proposer filter in `get_beacon_proposer_indices`, and `compute_ptc`.

`Gloas.Operations` inherits the handlers EIP-7732 leaves unchanged (`attester_slashing`,
`bls_to_execution_change`, `withdrawal_request`, `consolidation_request`,
`sync_aggregate`) verbatim. The ePBS-modified handlers are Gloas `forkdef`s:
`process_proposer_slashing` (Fulu's logic plus the builder-payment cleanup),
`process_voluntary_exit` and `process_deposit_request` (each fronted by a builder-index
branch over the builder registry). The builder-registry helpers (`is_builder_index`,
`is_active_builder`, `get_pending_balance_to_withdraw_for_builder`,
`initiate_builder_exit`, `apply_deposit_for_builder`, `add_builder_to_registry`,
`get_index_for_new_builder`, and the rest) land here and feed
`onboard_builders_from_pending_deposits`. The payload-aware `process_attestation` (the
`data.index < 2` payload bit and the same-slot builder-payment weight accounting), the
new `process_payload_attestation`, the bid (`process_execution_payload_bid`),
`process_parent_execution_payload`, and the PTC read helpers complete the surface. The
builder-aware `process_withdrawals` is the four-phase sweep (builder queue, pending
partials, builder sweep, validator sweep) with the running-list cap that composes across
phases. `Gloas/Transition.lean` reshapes `process_block` (drop
`process_execution_payload`, prepend `process_parent_execution_payload`, add
`process_execution_payload_bid`, payload-free `process_withdrawals`, the in-body
`process_payload_attestation`s), `process_slot` (clear the next slot's
payload-availability bit), and `process_epoch` (builder-pending-payments and
`process_ptc_window` last). The `transition` format folds pre-fork Fulu blocks, applies
`upgradeToGloas` plus onboarding at the boundary, then folds post-fork Gloas blocks.

## Config-tier values that bite

Three config values differ enough between presets to be worth flagging, because each one
was a real reject-faithfulness gap until set per preset:

- **`MAX_PER_EPOCH_ACTIVATION_EXIT_CHURN_LIMIT`** is `128000000000` Gwei at minimal,
  `256000000000` at mainnet. It only binds in `consolidation_request`, where a
  large-balance state pushes the balance churn between the two maxima, so
  `get_consolidation_churn_limit = balance_churn − activation_exit_churn` needs the right
  minimal value. The exit / registry vectors floor at `MIN_PER_EPOCH_CHURN_LIMIT_ELECTRA`
  below both maxima, so the cap never binds there.
- **`GLOAS_FORK_VERSION`** is `0x07000001` at minimal, `0x07000000` at mainnet.
  `upgradeToGloas` takes it as a parameter so the gloas `fork` format matches at both
  presets.
- **`MIN_BUILDER_WITHDRAWABILITY_DELAY`** is `2` at minimal, `8192` at mainnet. It bites
  only on the builder-exit branch at mainnet (minimal's `2` is correct), where
  `initiate_builder_exit` sets the builder's `withdrawable_epoch`. The full mainnet sweep
  is what exercises it.

## Harness

`pyspec_server` is a long-lived, crash-tolerant loop (a malformed request reports failed
and the loop continues), one per `pytest-xdist` worker via the `conftest.py` session
fixture (re-spawn on death). `harness.py` does acquisition / walk / snappy / request
encoding; `test_pyspec.py` is the reject-faithfulness verdict. The server emits one
tab-separated line per case, so two detail sources that could embed a newline and
desync the worker are flattened at the chokepoint: `EthCLLib.Spec.sanitizeDescr` takes
the first trimmed line of an `assert` descriptor, and `CaseResult.render` flattens any
newline / tab in the detail to a space (the detail is diagnostic only). The
`ServerClient` drains non-protocol lines (lake / startup stdout) and retries once on a
desynced or dead server, so the parallel run is deterministic.

## Genesis

`SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §10.1 marks `genesis` in scope and §6.1 names
`initializeBeaconStateFromEth1` / `isValidGenesisState`. The pytest corpus carries no
`genesis` vectors for Fulu or Gloas at the `v1.7.0-alpha.10` pin, so there is nothing to
drive; both stay a `todo` stub in `Interface.lean`.
