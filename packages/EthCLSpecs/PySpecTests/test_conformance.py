"""The conformance test: one parametrized test per vector case.

The harness builds a request from the case on disk and submits it to the
worker's Lean server; the server returns the driver's classify verdict. The
assertion follows the reject-faithfulness audit (`SPECS_ARCHITECTURE.md` §10.2):

- `bug` (`outOfBounds` / `missingKey` on well-formed input, or a server crash) is
  always a hard failure, the bug-smell the audit hunts for;
- `todo` (an unimplemented branch) is `xfail`, the Phase-2 work-queue: it does not
  fail the run, but it is visible and a vector that reaches it never passes
  silently;
- otherwise the case must `pass` (a valid vector's root matched, or an invalid
  vector was rejected by `assert`).

As Phase 2 fills the `todo` stubs, the `xfail`s turn into passes with no test
change.
